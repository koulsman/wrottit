        <p>This Website wasd developed between 2024 and 2025 by Stauros Koulas as a practice project.
            It is a Reddit clone, done for both educational purposes and as a portfolio project that showcases my expertees
             and my understanding of core concepts of React and Javascript. It displays the knowledge of multi-component interaction, redirection, state management, and the understanding of  
             developing big scale programms using the MERN stack.
